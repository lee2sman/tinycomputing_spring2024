## Critique with visiting guest

## Cyberdeck project requirements

Due March 12
    
* a cyberdeck, with name, customized OS/desktop, and installed software
* at least one costumed character
* produced images showing your character(s) with the cyberdeck
* A printed user guide to the cyberdeck  (this should included title, logo, description, diagram of the computer and its parts, and any background lore). You can have this be a pamphlet, website, zine, photocopied manual, etc.

New inspiration: [Zachtronics' Last Call BBS](https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/)

Retro manual inspiration: [The Tom Swift Terminal](https://archive.org/details/ETC3140)

Neo-"Cyberpunk" design inspo from Cyberpunk 2077: a fake website https://www.nightcity.love/en/

Consider how you’ll build the visual iconography and interface for your cyberdeck, inspired by the cyberpunk aesthetics and scenes we’ve viewed, or something new that you conceive of. Your cyberdeck should complement your character (and vice versa).

At minimum, the cyberdeck should have:

* a logo or video (or animated gif) that should run on startup
* a custom startup sound that plays on startup
* a selected or produced background that fits the concept
* customized terminal software and prompt
