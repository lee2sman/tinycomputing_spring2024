### Intro to Fabrication: Laser Cutter 

![Lasercutting]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lasercut.jpg)  
A laser cutter is a CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) machine. You design in software and the machine cuts it out with lasers. They can cut cardboard, some plastics, paper, wood and more. They are used for rapid prototyping and are relatively affordable to use.

A laser cutter works like a printer. A driver takes the file from the computer and sends information to the laser. The laser resonator sends a beam of thin light strong enough to cut into material. The driver moves the laser head around on the X and Y axis. Different lasers use different kinds of lasers.
