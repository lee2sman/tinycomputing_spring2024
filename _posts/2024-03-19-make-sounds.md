## Student research lab

Dotfiles - Rin

> Dotfiles are the plain text configuration files on your systems. They store settings of almost every application, service and tool running. These files control the behavior of applications from boot to termination and everything in between.

Permissions - Michael

> owner, group, all users

Shebangs - Chris

> comes in handy to inform the terminal about what kind of script we're running

> it gives the user higher authority for a time

Chmod - Isaiah

> Read, Write, Execute

Cron/crontab - Lex

> crond is a daemon (a thing that runs in the background) that checks once a minute to see ifany of teh scheduled jobs need to be executed.


Auto-post to a server - Sacia

> Using two pi's, one as server, one connecting via ssh.

Python vs JS on Pi - Julian

> Scientific, shorter, readable

Working with Sensors - Matthew

> a device used to detect and measure physical occurrences in the surrounding environment. These sensors can measure various parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, motion, sound, distance, pressure, and many more. 

Button input in Python - Ed

* The difference between Broadcom BCM and Board pin number schemes

Button input in Node-Red - Isaac

> connect external button to GPIO pins. Set up access. Write code in Node-RED

### Makey Makey prototyping

See our Bok Joy demo.


Build a prototyping performance device. It can make music and/or visuals. Decide the device and purpose, then build with a Makey Makey and the language and hardware of your choice. The goal is to prototype this project, in a rapid prototyping approach. Use cardboard, tape/glue, speakers, etc on your Pi.
