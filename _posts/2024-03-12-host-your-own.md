### Etherbox

> Etherbox is a constellation of collective tools and practices that developed in and around Constant5. Etherbox responds to practical issues when collaborating in physical spaces with digital tools. In parallel, it became a platform to reflect on network technologies, on how to document artistic processes and on processes of collaboration.

## Networks Of Ones Own

> Networks Of One's Own is a para-nodal periodic publication that is itself collectively written in a network2. Each of the episodes is thought of as the 'release' of a specific software stack, contextualised in its specific practice. The series aims to document a set of tools, experiences, ways of working that are diverse in terms of their temporality, granularity and persistence.--from [Network of Ones Own](https://networksofonesown.constantvzw.org/etherbox/manual.html)

## A Feminist Server

From the Feminist Server Manifesto 0.01

A feminist serverâ€¦ 

* Is a situated technology. She has a sense of context and considers herself to be part of an ecology of practices
* Is run for and by a community that cares enough for her in order to make her exist
* Builds on the materiality of software, hardware and the bodies gathered around it
* Opens herself to expose processes, tools, sources, habits, patterns
* Does not strive for seamlessness. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible
* Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be traps
* Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous and parasitic practice
* Is autonomous in the sense that she decides for her own dependencies
* Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; experiments with changing client-server relations where she can
* Treats network technology as part of a social reality
* Wants networks to be mutable and read-write accessible
* Does not confuse safety with security
* Takes the risk of exposing her insecurity
* Tries hard not to apologize when she is sometimes not available

## Freedombox

> Launched in 2010 by Prof. Eben Moglen, FreedomBox is a global project to empower regular people to reassert control over the infrastructure of the internet. FreedomBox empowers its users to avoid the data mining, censorship and surveillance by centralized silos that characterize the web of today. It makes web servers personal, affordable and manageable, so that a user can host necessary web services at home on a device they own, powered by free software they can trust.
> FreedomBox is made up of two things: a free and open source software system and inexpensive hardware. The costs of computer processors and network bandwidth have both fallen to such low levels that hosting your own digital services is now affordable.
> FreedomBox is a private server for non-experts: it lets you install and configure server applications with only a few clicks. It runs on cheap hardware of your choice, uses your internet connection and power, and is under your control. 
>  FreedomBox, a Debian pure blend, is a 100% free software self-hosting web server to deploy social applications on small machines. It provides online communication tools respecting your privacy and data ownership.

## Yunohost

![Yunohost]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/yunohost.png)  

> YunoHost is an operating system aiming to simplify server administration and therefore democratize self-hosting while making sure it stays reliable, secure, ethical and lightweight. It is a copylefted libre software project maintained exclusively by volunteers. Technically, it can be seen as a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux and can be installed on many kinds of hardware.
